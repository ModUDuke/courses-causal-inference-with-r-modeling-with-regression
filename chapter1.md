Which of the following are examples where we might apply discrete choice analysis?
  
A) Learning the effect of a new cancer drug on life expectancy
B) Learning whether giving people informational brochures affects whether they take prescription drugs as prescribed, such as whether they take antibiotics for the entire duration of the prescription or whether they stop early once they feel that symptoms have disappeared.
C) Learning whether a certain plant thrives under warmer or colder weather.
D) Learning the effect of the income tax on whether people participate in the labor market or not.

- We might hope this drug works, but we're looking for examples of when people make choices. Try again.
- There is another answer that also qualifies, so try again.
- We are looking for examples of when humans make choices. Try again.
- There is another answer that also qualifies, so try again.
- In (A) and (C) we are still interested in causal effects, but now there are no people making decisions, so discrete choice analysis (usually) will not apply.
- Correct! These are both situations where a person is making a discrete choice. In (B) they are decided whether to take the drug as prescribed. In (D) they are deciding whether to participate in the labor market. Hence we can use discrete choice analysis to study the causal effects of various policies. In (A) and (C) we are still interested in causal effects, but now there are no people making decisions, so discrete choice analysis (usually) will not apply.
